## Ontheway

Let your bartender know you're on the way. If you've checked in several times with a bartender, let them know how big your group is and maybe she'll save you a spot at the bar.

Once you get there, we'll automatically check you in.

## Improved Drinks

See where drinks fall on classy to adventurous, easy going to aggressive, and sweet to savory.

## Delayed content posting

Post drinks, pictures, and shouts after you've checked in.
(And yeah, we put photo filters in too.)

## Thanks and Compliments

Have a great night out? That's awesome. Leave a thank you compliment for your bartender.
He can also send you notes the next day. And of course receiving compliments and thanks raises both your cred.

## Get out there!

Tip well and have fun.
